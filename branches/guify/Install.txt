Platforms:
==========

This software was developped on Linux using GCC

Installation instructions:
==========================

Dependencies:

- scons, excellent software construction tool painless "make" replacement, can be obtained there: http://www.scons.org
- optional cppunitlite library (for unit tests), can be obtained there: http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/downloads/bin/CppUnitLite.zip
- optional excellent "Stones of Nvwa" library (for memory leaks), can be obtained there: http://sourceforge.net/projects/nvwa
- optional excellent "rLog" library (for logging), can be obtained there: http://arg0.net/wiki/rlog

Decompress the archive, cd into the resulting directory and at a command prompt:
prompt> scons

This will build the syncPod executable in the bld/src directory.

prompt> scons -h

will give you the options you can set:

debug: Set to 1 to build with debug symbols
    default: 0
    actual: 0

tests: Set to 1 to build and run unit tests
    default: 0
    actual: 0

rlog: Set to 1 to try to use the rLog library
    default: 0
    actual: 0

nvwa: Set to 1 to try to use the "Stones of Nvwa" library
    default: 0
    actual: 0

- Setting 'debug' to 1 (scons debug=1) will allow you to run the program inside gdb
- Setting 'tests' to 1 (scons tests=1) will compile and run the unit tests for the helper classes
- Setting 'rlog' to 1 (scons rlog=1) will attempt to detect whether the rlog development files are 
present and use them (provide feedback about what the program is doing on stdout).
- Setting 'nvwa' to 1 (scons nvwa=1) will attempt to detect whether the "Stones of Nvwa" 
development files are present and use them (will report memory leaks information)
