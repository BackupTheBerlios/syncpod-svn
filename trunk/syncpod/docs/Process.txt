Some sort of process (more a bullet list of things to do) when I develop syncpod:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* UNIT TEST everything that can be unit tested.
* Try to isolate changes i.e. don't change many things in one change set, try to do one thing, get it right and commit it.
* Run the unit/regression test suite(s) BEFORE any commit. Currently, the regression test suite is a bit inexistant, but
sanity checks can be run: run with memory leak detection, check that the synch process is successful.
* Do not ignore warnings issued by the tools (gcc, doxygen, anything), rather fix them as soon as they appear.
* Keep the documentation up-to-date, specially the publicly visible,. There's not that much anyway:)
* Switch between mingw and cygwin regularly and make sure they are no differences.

Misc. things:
-------------
To check that syncpod do not leak:
   scons rlog=0 nvwa=1
as rlog leaks due to dynamic allocations in static object constructors (I think...).

To run the unit tests:
   scons tests=1

To be able to use gdb(insight):
   scons debug=1

All of the above can be used at the same time or independently (to check that unit tests don't leak for example).
